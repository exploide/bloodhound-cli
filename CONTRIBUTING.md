# Contributing

You want to contribute to this project? Awesome! Please take the following points into consideration.


## Creating Issues

- Search for existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- Provide all the information necessary to understand and possibly reproduce the issue you have.


## Creating Pull Requests

- For minor fixes or trivial enhancements, it is not necessary to create an issue beforehand.
- Before contributing substantial changes or new features, consider opening an issue first. We can then discuss how your idea integrates best with the existing code. This can avoid a potentially unsatisfying review experience.
- Changes will be reviewed to keep the code quality high. Running a linter on the code before submission is a good idea.
